## Summary

This presentation looks at the various ways we can build and develop NLP pipelines for text classification tasks like author identification and sentiment analysis. The presentation plans to cover the following approaches:

1. Simple Knowledge Bases using Forward and Backward Chaining
2. Hidden Markov Models (HMM)
3. Naive Bayes Classifier
4. K-Nearest Neighbors
5. Support Vector Machine
6. Logistic Regression
7. Simple Feed-Forward Neural Network
8. Recurrent Neural Network
9. Long-Short Term Memory Network
10. Gated Recurrent Unit Network
11. Simple Transformer
12. HuggingFace Classifiers
