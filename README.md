## Summary

This presentation looks at the various ways we can build and develop NLP pipelines for text classification tasks like author identification and sentiment analysis. The presentation plans to cover the following approaches:

1. Simple Knowledge Base
2. Naive Bayes Classifier
3. K-Nearest Neighbors
4. Support Vector Machine
5. Logistic Regression
6. Simple Feed-Forward Neural Network
7. Recurrent Neural Network
10. Simple Transformer
11. HuggingFace Classifiers
