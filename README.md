## Summary

This presentation looks at the various ways we can build and develop NLP pipelines for text classification tasks like author identification and sentiment analysis. The presentation plans to cover the following approaches:

1. Simple Knowledge Bases using Forward and Backward Chaining
2. Naive Bayes Classifier
3. K-Nearest Neighbors
4. Support Vector Machine
5. Logistic Regression
6. Simple Feed-Forward Neural Network
7. Recurrent Neural Network
8. Long-Short Term Memory Network
9. Gated Recurrent Unit Network
10. Simple Transformer
11. HuggingFace Classifiers
